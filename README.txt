Notes:

Created a robust function to provide readability as well as memory efficiency to the best of my ability.
Allows different list types of input and additionally checks for any wrong data types in list.

Areas of improvement:
use of unittest test module to provide better auto-testing with lots of inputs and improvements on
error messages such as wrong input to ensure user understands the scope of the error.

Also improvements need to be made for checking instance of each element as currently it repeats message 
if there are more than one wrong data type in list.
